  <h2> 
    Dear Delegates,<br><br>

    It is my honor to welcome you all to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). This committee carries a special weight, as the issues we face are not only technical, but deeply tied to the future stability and prosperity of our world. From shaping fair fiscal rules to strengthening financial systems, and from addressing crises to unlocking investment in green and digital growth, the work you do here will reflect diplomacy at its best.<br><br>
    
    ECOFIN stands out as one of the greatest committees because it sits at the heart of global economic decision-making. With Europe long serving as a center of trade, finance, and innovation, the discussions we hold here go far beyond numbers, they shape how economies interact, how crises are managed, and how cooperation is built across borders. The influence of this committee reflects the reality that when Europe acts together, it has the power to guide not only its own future but also the direction of the global economy.<br><br>
    
    As your President, my role is to guide and support you in creating meaningful debate that is fair, respectful, and productive. You will find that ECOFIN thrives when every voice is heard. Whether you are representing a large economy or a small one, your ideas matter. I encourage you to step forward, take risks in your arguments, and most importantly, work with one another. True diplomacy is not about speaking the loudest, but about building bridges, negotiating differences, and finding solutions that leave no member behind.<br><br>
    
    This committee will challenge you, but it will also reward you. The rules of procedure, the pace of debate, and the responsibility of resolution-writing are all here to test your skill and focus. But remember, you are not alone in this process. Alongside the chairing panel, I am committed to making sure every delegate has the tools, guidance, and support they need to succeed.<br><br>
    
    Let us make this session one where ECOFIN is remembered for its respect, creativity, and cooperation. I look forward to seeing each of you bring your countryâ€™s perspective to the table, and to witnessing the kind of diplomacy that inspires change not only within this room, but far beyond it.<br><br>
    
    Yours sincerely,<br>
    Karim AlShurafa<br>
    President of ECOFIN

  <h2> 
    Dear Delegates of The First General Assembly,<br><br>

    I am honoured to welcome you to our committee,<br><br>
    
    This committee is a platform where delegates will be discussing pressing international issues and topics of importance which require immediate tending to. The General Assembly is one of six key organs of the United Nations which plays a key role in addressing pressing issues. Each one of you will represent member states of this esteemed committee and you will also be the voice of the millions of people who don't have their own.<br><br>
    
    And always keep in mind, the resolutions and debate we pass and foster can have an enormous effect on the future of diplomatic and international relations and on millions of people's lives. As we indulge in our topics, you will participate in heated debate, propose solutions, and exercise your thinking and communication skills.<br><br>
    
    Throughout these three days, whether you are a first timer or an experienced MUN participant, I expect that you will demonstrate your debating skills, critical thinking, and collaboration skills with your fellow delegates. You will learn how to critique proposed resolutions, enhance your debating, and ultimately challenge yourself to become political enthusiasts and excellent debaters.<br><br>
    
    Delegates, I want you to step out of your comfort zones, explore the MUN world, seize this opportunity, and indulge in heated and meaningful debate and discussion. What we discuss in this committee can be the next step to a better tomorrow, a better world where no one is labelled by race, colour, or status, one step closer to equality. Seize this opportunity and become true citizens of the world who contribute to global peace.<br><br>
    
    With that being said, my name is Amro Abu Libbeh, President of The First General Assembly at The Modern Montessori Model United Nations, and I am honoured to be your president for this year.<br><br>
    
    I wish you all the best of luck.<br><br>
    
    Sincerely,<br>
    Amro Abu-Libbeh<br>
    President of The First General Assembly

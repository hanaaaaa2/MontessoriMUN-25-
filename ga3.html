  <h2> 
    Dear Delegates,<br><br>

    It is with great pride and sincere honor that I welcome you to the United Nations Third General Assembly at MontessoriMUN’25. My name is Julie AlMadani, a Junior at the International Academy-Amman, and I am privileged to serve as your President for this year’s conference. My chairing panel and I are deeply committed to cultivating an atmosphere of intellectual rigor, intense debate, and collective growth. Whether this is your first Model United Nations experience or one of many, I hope this conference becomes a key part in your journey that improves your ability to think critically, speak confidently, and engage meaningfully in discourse.<br><br>
    
    Walking into my first MUN experience, I was no more than a thirteen-year-old seeking means of amplifying my voice. Feeling helpless as I read different news articles about the violations of human rights, it wasn’t until my first conference that I found a channel to use my voice to catalyze change and satiate my curiosity. MUN became the answer to that hunger; it became a place where my voice and those of other young people could reverberate amidst global challenges. I hope this conference can do the same for you, giving you the chance to use your voice and discover just how powerful it can be.<br><br>
    
    This year, our committee will be addressing two issues that stand at the heart of resilience. The first, Protecting Communities Displaced by Climate Change in the Pacific Islands, compels us to reflect on what it truly means to defend human dignity when entire nations face the threat of disappearing beneath rising seas. It is a topic that forces us to think beyond borders and to consider identity, sovereignty, and justice in an era of climate crisis.<br><br>
    
    The second, Mitigating Food Shortages in the Sahel Amid Climate Shocks, draws our attention to a region where environmental pressures and humanitarian need collide. The Sahel reminds us that hunger is tied to security, development, and survival. As you debate on this topic, I want you to think about the struggles people face right now, while also imagining how their future can be made more resilient.<br><br>
    
    Let understanding lead your discussions, prove your commitment to the greater good through debates, and let cooperation guide your way. I am confident that you will all step out of your comfort zones, especially in a world where words matter more than power.<br><br>
    
    May your voices echo for those who have been silenced, delegates.<br><br>
    
    See you on the 16th of October!<br><br>
    
    Your president,<br>
    Julie AlMadani<br>

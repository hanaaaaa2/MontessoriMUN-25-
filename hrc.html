      <h2> 
        Honorable delegates of the Human Rights Council,<br><br>

        It is my utmost pleasure to welcome you to MontessoriMUN’25! My name is Leen Mansour, and I have the great honor of serving as your President for this year’s HRC, alongside our esteemed deputy, Safa Alkhudairy, and our respected chair, Karam Abboud. With the guidance and support of your chairing panel, I am confident that this committee will not only be impactful and productive, but also a truly memorable experience for every one of us.<br><br>
        
        As The Human Rights Council has always held a special place in my heart, and is the one committee where every debate, every resolution, and every discussion carries not only significance, but the power to truly impact lives around the world. It is the very power to influence real change that makes our work here so meaningful. This year, we are entrusted with two critical topics that demand both careful thought and empathy, so be prepared to engage fully, think critically, and speak passionately.<br><br>
        
        Our first agenda, the ethical implications in the development and deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS), calls on us to examine the intersection of technology, accountability, and human dignity. Meanwhile, our second topic, addressing child labor in the gold and cobalt mining industry of the Democratic Republic of Congo, challenges us to confront the hidden suffering behind global progress and to find solutions that protect the most vulnerable among us.<br><br>
        
        By working collaboratively with other delegates to address these pressing human rights issues, we will navigate the complexities of international relations together, step by step. Remember to be prepared to engage fully, listen with empathy, and contribute your unique perspective to the debates. As I encourage you all to get out of your comfort zones, voice your ideas and thoughts, bring your insight and your passion to this committee seeing as it's only one of the many MUN experiences that you will hopefully be a part of in the future. No matter what happens, no one's there to judge—everyone has different perspectives, and there is no right or wrong.<br><br>
        
        I look forward to making this committee as meaningful and memorable for you as it has always been for me.<br><br>
        
        Best Regards,<br>
        Leen Mansour<br>
        President of the Human Rights Council

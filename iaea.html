  <h2> 
    Esteemed Delegates,<br><br>

    I'm honoured to welcome you all to this yearâ€™s International Atomic Energy Agency!<br><br>
    
    For the past two years, MontessoriMUN has become an integral part of my MUN journey, from beginning as a delegate in the Human Rights Council, to serving as Chair of that very committee the following year, and now President of this year's International Atomic Energy Agency. I've had the opportunity to grow through and with this conference.<br><br>
    
    The International Atomic Energy Agency serves as the world's centre for cooperation in the nuclear field. It aims to promote safe, secure as well as peaceful use of nuclear energy for the benefit of all countries. The IAEA's work serves as a reminder that science, diplomacy, as well as responsibility must coexist in a time where global issues demand cooperation.<br><br>
    
    This year's International Atomic Energy Agency will discuss the following topics: Combating the Resurgence of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) in the Middle East, and Discussing the Risks of Proliferation from Emerging Nuclear Technologies in South Asia. These topics will push you all to come up with realistic and logical solutions to solve such issues in the nuclear field. This committee introduces a new procedure and will challenge you beyond your own perceived limits by challenging your political knowledge and adaptability skills. I encourage you all to step out of your comfort zone and to embrace the challenges ahead.<br><br>
    
    My name is Jeeda Zalloum, a Junior at Ahliyyah and Mutran, and I'm honored to serve as President of this year's International Atomic Energy Agency! I cannot wait to meet you all and can't wait to see you all debate passionately throughout the conference!<br><br>
    
    Wish you all the best of luck!<br><br>
    
    Best regards,<br>
    Jeeda Zalloum<br>
    President of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

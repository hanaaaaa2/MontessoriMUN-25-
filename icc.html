  <h2> 
    Dear Advocates, <br> <br> 
    It is with immense pride and excitement that I welcome you all to the International Criminal Court at Montessori Model United Nations. This committee stands as one of the most powerful symbols of justice a place where truth, accountability, and courage meet. <br> <br> 
    As President of the ICC, I am deeply honored to witness each of you step into the shoes of those who uphold justice, challenge wrongdoing, and give voice to those who have been silenced. MUN is not just about debating laws or following procedure. It’s about
    empathy understanding the complexity of human choices, the weight of evidence, and the stories behind every case. In this court, you will not only analyze facts but also explore morality, ethics, and the very meaning of justice in our world. Every argument you make, every witness you call, and every objection you raise will remind us that justice is never static it is something we must actively protect. <br> <br> To the advocates: let your words be grounded in truth but fueled by passion. To the witnesses: embody the humanity behind each testimony. And to the judges: let fairness and reason guide your verdicts. Each of you plays a vital role in shaping not only the
    outcome of your case but also the spirit of this court. <br> <br> This year’s ICC will be intense, emotional, and transformative as justice should be. I encourage you to think deeply, collaborate fearlessly, and argue with conviction. Remember, justice is not found in punishment alone, but in understanding, integrity, and
    courage. <br> <br> I am beyond proud to lead a committee that challenges its members to think, feel, and act with purpose. Together, let us make this session one to remember not just for its outcomes, but for the ideals it represents. <br><br> 
    Welcome to the International Criminal Court. <br> <br> 
    Let justice prevail. <br>
    Warm regards, <br> 
    Antone Qasir <br>
    President of the International Criminal Court

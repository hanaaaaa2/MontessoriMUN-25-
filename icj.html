  <h2>
    Dear esteemed advocates of the court,<br><br>

    My name is Hind Koudsi, I’m a junior at the Modern Montessori School, and I am of utmost honor to serve you as your President for the International Court of Justice for this year’s MontessoriMUN. Alongside my respected deputy president Omar Hyasat and chair Rayan Durak. I look forward to guiding you through what promises to be an engaging, challenging, and thought-provoking experience. As this is my first time presiding over ICJ and my first experience as President, I wish to make it special for both my advocates and fellow chairs, and hopefully, our time together will leave each of us with enjoyable memories we will cherish, and insights we will carry beyond this committee itself.<br><br>
    
    The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, tasked with resolving disputes between states through law, evidence, and fairness rather than politics. But to me, that’s only a fraction of what it ever truly meant to me, as finding my way to court allowed me to express the inner fuel, passion, and fire my character holds and helped shape me into a more empathetic and noble person, which I will forever be grateful for.<br><br>
    
    This year, our committee will focus deeply on a single, complex case: Iran v. Canada, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, concerning the tragic downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 on the morning of January 8th, 2020, near Tehran, Iran. Tragically, 176 lives were lost as a result of this incident. Over the course of the three days, you will fully dedicate yourselves to examining this case from every angle, considering the sequence of events, legal principles involved, and even the broader questions it raises regarding state obligations, sovereignty, aviation safety, and accountability under international law. Every argument, piece of evidence, and witness you consider will help us gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of the complexities and implications at the heart of this case.<br><br>
    
    You were chosen for this committee because you have the ability to make a difference and shape the verdict of this case. This is your chance to stand for justice, uphold your position, and prove your case with clarity and conviction. Step into this role fully, as this is your chance to prove what it truly means to be an advocate in the International Court of Justice.<br><br>
    
    Best regards and wishes,<br>
    Hind Koudsi<br>
    President of International Court of Justice

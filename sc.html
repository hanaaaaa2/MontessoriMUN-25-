  <h2> 
    Honorable Delegates of the Security Council, <br> <br> 
    My name is Yara Al Rousan, a junior at the Modern Montessori School, and this year’s President of the Security Council. I am very honored to sail on my 9th experience in my favorite committee with each and everyone of you today. For me, the Security Council has never been just another committee; it is the heart of the United Nations, the very table where silence carries as much weight as screams, and where every choice we deliberate ripples across nations and lives. <br> <br> 
    What makes the Security Council special is its duality; as it is both the smallest and yet the most powerful body, both a space for fiery confrontation and delicate compromise. It is the council where the world looks to us for guidance. Every decision carries immense responsibility, shaping the actions of governments and influencing the course of global events, and that is exactly why I fell in love with it. The SC demands sharp thinking, but it also demands empathy. It requires strength, but equally patience. It is, to me, the purest test of what it means to be a delegate. <br> <br> 
    I hold this council close to my heart because it has taught me more than just procedure or politics, but in fact it has taught me the value of listening as much as speaking, of finding humanity in negotiation, and of standing firm when it matters the most. As your President, I hope to guide you through intense debate and moments of doubt, but also to create a space full of excitement, growth, and leave you with loads of great memories! <br> <br> 
    Delegates, come ready to defend your nations and discover your own potential. In SC there are no limitations for heated debates, so expect a council that is both disciplined and energetic, challenging yet encouraging, and truly unforgettable. <br> <br> 
    Thank you all, can’t wait to see you in MontessoriMUN’25 Security Council!

  <h2> 
Dear Delegates,<br><br>

My name is Mira Gharaibeh, a student at The International Academy - Amman, and it is my honor to welcome you to this year’s Interstellar Council.<br><br>
    
Special committees have always stood out to me because they feel less like walking into a set path and more like stepping into something unpredictable. They give you space to debate freely, fiercely and without fear of the unexpected, build secret alliances that you wouldn’t have expected to make, and sometimes watch those alliances crumble just as quickly. No two sessions ever look the same, and that’s what makes them exciting and is what personally drew me to them.<br><br>
    
When I was in your place two years ago, I didn’t know what to expect. I walked into my first special committee with what felt like a combination of curiosity, excitement, and naturally slight fear. By the end, I left with a new perspective, not only for MUN, but for myself. I realized how much can happen in a few days when you’re pushed to think differently, trust your instincts, and shift your perspective completely. What I can promise you though, is that you will not walk into the conference with your eight hours and that you will walk out questioning everything you know about MUN.<br><br>
    
This year, you’ll find that the Interstellar Council is as much about the people around you as it is about the issues at hand. The moments you share, the debates you drive forward, and the risks you take will shape the atmosphere of the committee more than anything else. MontessoriMUN special committees have always had a special place in my heart and this year is no different.<br><br>
    
That’s what I hope this Interstellar Council becomes for you: a space where you surprise yourself, where you take risks, and where you leave with memories worth holding on to.<br><br>
    
I look forward to seeing how you make this committee your own. See you all on the 16th!<br><br>
    
From the Gallery, watching your every move,<br>
Mira Gharaibeh<br>
President, Interstellar Council

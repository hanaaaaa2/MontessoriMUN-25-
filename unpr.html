  <h2> 
    Dear United Nations Press Release delegates,<br><br>

    It is my honour and pleasure to preside for one last time in UNPR. I am Nusaybah Elbusaifi, a senior at Modern Montessori School, and the deputy secretary general for this year’s MontessoriMun’25.<br><br>
    
    In an era where technology dominates our daily lives, impacting our work, education, and personal interactions, it is crucial to wield this powerful tool with responsibility, justice, and fairness. Many of our voices are being silenced by governments and institutions that are meant to protect us. It is our duty to amplify these voices, helping to ensure that they resonate around the world.<br><br>
    
    MUN means something different for everybody; one might see it as an opportunity to get into a good university, another might see it as a way to make new relationships, but for me, it’s an opportunity to get over my fears and become a better version of myself. MUN teaches you to speak, to empathize, and to write, all important skills that make us better people. People who not just speak, but rather take action, not only for themselves but also for others.<br><br>
    
    I write this letter to help alleviate any anxiety you may have, to guide you to becoming a better person than yesterday, and to enjoy your experience that will have a lasting impact on you.<br><br>
    
    Thank you and best of luck,<br> <br> 
    DSG<br>
    President of UNPR<br>
    Nusaybah Elbusaifi.

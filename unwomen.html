  <h2>
    Dear Delegates, <br> <br> 
    My name is Sersa Janbek, a student at the Modern Montessori School, serving as co-Secretary-General and President of the UN Women Committee for MontessoriMUN 2025 along side my deputy Mira Sehwail, and my co-chairs, Alesha Zakarneh and George Mosleh.
    <br> <br> As MontessoriMUN 2025 approaches, I would like to take a moment to address you all. This conference holds a special place in my heart, as it marks the conclusion of my own MUN journey. For me, Model United Nations has always been more than just a conference. It has been a space of growth, learning, and transformation, and I hope that throughout this experience you will come to see it in the same way.
    <br> <br> MUN is not only a forum for debate and diplomacy, but also a platform you can evolve, develop, and push beyond their comfort zones. It may sound like a cliché, but I truly mean it when I say that without MUN I would not be who I am today. The experiences I have gained are permanently engraved in my identity, and they are something I will always miss and cherish. Along this journey I have built lifelong friendships and met incredible people who shaped me into the person I have become.
    <br> <br> To my UNW delegates, I can promise you that this conference will be an unforgettable experience filled with meaningful debate, collaboration, and of course, moments of joy. To make the most of it, do not allow the conference to come to you unprepared. The success of your experience depends on the effort you put into it beforehand. Arrive fully prepared, and you will find yourself excelling not only as delegates but also as individuals.
    <br> <br> I look forward to seeing all of you bring your passion, dedication, and energy to MontessoriMUN 2025. 
    <br> <br> Sersa Janbek, 
    <br>  Co-SG and President of UNW, 
    <br>  MontessoriMUN’25.
